# ILL Eye Identifier

## Inspiration
Around 27.5% of Indians Suffer from vision problems. It's a serious issue and will be more common in upcoming days due to excessive screen time in electronic gadgets.
Many people lack access to eye care services, especially those who reside in underdeveloped or distant areas. This may be caused by a shortage of qualified eye care specialists, as well as a lack of infrastructure and other means of transportation.
Eye care can be expensive, and many people may not be able to afford the cost of treatment or surgery.
Some people may feel anxiety or fear about undergoing surgery, which can prevent them from seeking treatment.
We found out about these eye diseases while searching for topics for the hackathon and decided to work on them.

## What it does
Identifying and diagnosing eye diseases using various methods such as medical imaging, visual acuity tests, and other eye exams. The goal of eye disease detection is to detect eye diseases early, before they cause significant damage or vision loss.
Once an eye disease is detected, the eye care professional can work with the patient to develop a treatment plan, which may include medication, lifestyle changes, or surgery.
Overall, eye disease detection is an important part of eye care that helps to identify eye diseases early and prevent significant vision loss.

## How we built it
We collected datasets of various eye diseases using web scraping and preprocessed it.
Our model was trained using CNNs and advanced CNNs like ResNet, MobileNet, Yolov3 to improve accuracy.

## Challenges we ran into
Collecting datasets was a challenging task.
Exploring many eye diseases with less resources was a quite difficult task. 
Learning and using  advanced CNNs like ResNet, MobileNet, Yolov3 was quite challenging as it was new to us.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The dataset was successfully able to differentiate eye disease problems, and we are happy that this will be a new step toward solving social-related problems in the future.
We welcome the opportunity to tackle eye diseases at an early stage so that people can take wonderful care of their eyes with less cost in the future.
## What we learned
Early detection is important to prevent significant vision loss.
People may not receive treatment for eye disorders for a variety of reasons, such as lack of access to eye care, cost, lack of awareness, stigma, lack of priority, and fear or anxiety.
One should not look for money always but help needy people as much as possible, even it's a small step to take.
Technology for good is not only a good initiative, but is a great one.
